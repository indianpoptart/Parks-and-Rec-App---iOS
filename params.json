It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use core features of this app and hopefully get more users because you built something cool.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, that would make my year :).\r\n\r\n## Helping out\r\n\r\nFeel free to help me squash bugs\r\n\r\n## Third-Party Plugins\r\nThank you [topfunky](http://topfunky.com) for creating [hpple](https://github.com/topfunky/hpple), useful for website scraping and getting data from the website\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
